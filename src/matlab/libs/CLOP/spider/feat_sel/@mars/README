This is a template object, copying this directory and editing it should
make it easy to create new objects. It implements a simple SVM for
pattern recognition. 
The files are the following:

template.m % constructor -- needs to include all hyperparameter and model 
           %                parameter declarations

training.m % these two files are the core of any object -- they train
testing.m  % the algorithm given data and test the learnt model

get_name % used for printing the name, you only need to edit this file
         % if you want to output special hyperparameters of your object
         % when the name is printed out

get.m % used for getting parameters, you do not need to edit this file

set.m % used for setting parameters, you do not need to edit this file
